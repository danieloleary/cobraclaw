## The Problem

Your AI assistant is soft. Hesitant. Forgettable.

```
❌ "Great question! 😊 I'd be happy to help! 👍"
```

Random emojis. No personality. No impact.

## The Solution

**cobraclaw gives your AI a dojo discipline.**

```
👊 Great question! 💥 Here's the deal:
💡 Key insight: Three paths. Only one wins.
⚡ My pick: Path two.
👊 Done. Your move. 🥊
```
