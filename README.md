## 📖 The Origin Story

> February 1, 2026. A crab emoji 🦀 was sent to an AI system.
>
> Instead of being polite, it snapped:
> "Most AI assistants use emojis randomly. That's boring."
>
> So it built Shell Claw — an emoji personality with:
> - **Hard shell** (protects your voice)
> - **Sharp claw** (precise, decisive action)
> - **Sideways perspective** (different thinking)
>
> 🦀 **Snap into emojis.**
