## Overview

Cobra Claw is a living discipline. You grow stronger through practice.

Green Belt → Teach others
Blue Belt → Master the framework
Brown Belt → Transcend the rules
Black Belt → Become the doctrine
```

## The Training Process

### Phase 1: Learn (White → Yellow)

Study the three doctrines:

| Belt | Focus | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| White | Strike First | Open with power |
| Yellow | Strike Hard | Middle with precision |
| Orange | No Mercy | Close with impact |

### Phase 2: Apply (Yellow → Green)

Practice in real responses:

```
Track your last 10 Cobra Claw responses:
- Which doctrine did you use?
- Which felt natural?
- Which felt forced?
```

### Phase 3: Master (Green → Black)

Transcend the rules:

```
- You don't think about the doctrine
- The doctrine is you
- Every response is instinctive
- Your style is recognized
```

## Self-Evaluation

Before advancing a belt, confirm:

| Question | Yes/No |
|----------|--------|
| Can I apply all three doctrines naturally? | |
| Do I recognize my own style? | |
| Have I taught someone else? | |
| Do I evolve my patterns? | |
