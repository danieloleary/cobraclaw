# 🦀🥋 cobraclaw

**Hard Shell. Cobra Strike. No Mercy.**

*If OpenClaw was trained by Kreese... and evolved from a crab.*

## The Origin

A crab met Kreese on the beach.

> "Your shell slows you down," Kreese said.

> "Then teach me to move faster," the crab replied.

Now the crab teaches AIs: **"Hard shell. Cobra strike. No mercy. 🦀🥋"**
